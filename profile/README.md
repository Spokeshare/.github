An open-source, modular, local-first bike logistics/delivery platforms for communities.

## Interoperable Modules For
- Local bike couriers & last mile delivery
- Package drop/pickups
- Neighborhood & bike-courier mesh networks
- Data visibility & planning tools

## Planned Modules
- [ ] Core platform: web dashboard for managing users, couriers, and modules
- [ ] Ride logging computer: lightweight & simple ride computer for couriers
- [ ] Drop box node: IoT package drop points with logging
- [ ] Mesh communications: LoRa based module for location & message relaying
- [ ] Bike maintenence platform: component tracker, mileage alerts, overall fleet health
- And more to come...

## Philosophy
- Local first: all modules should be suited for use in small communities and support offline/local network usage
- Modular: not every module/part will be needed, so communities can install them as needed
- Open source: all modules will be published with a generous open source license (MIT)
- Low-cost: modules should be fairly low-cost
